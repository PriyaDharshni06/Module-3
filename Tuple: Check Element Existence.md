# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `52 and 12` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `52 and 12` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
``` python
a=eval(input())
print(True if '52' in a else False)
print(True if '12' in a else False)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus  Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `52 and 12` exist within a given tuple is executed successfully.
