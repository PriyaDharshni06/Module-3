# Module-3
# ðŸ§¹ Strings-Remove Nth Index Character from a String

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that accepts a string and joins the character after a each character.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1.Start

2.Define a function joinstring(text)

3.Use "-".join(text) to insert hyphens between characters of the string text

4.Store the result in a variable result

5.Print result

6.End



## ðŸ’» Program
``` python
def joinstring(text):
    result = "-".join(text)
    print(result)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus the Python program that accepts a string and joins the character after a each character is executed successsfully.
